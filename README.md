# Re-export Analysis: Commodity Shocks & Sector Volatility in Singapore

Singapore’s re-export hub connects producers and buyers across Asia, Europe, and the Middle East. This project investigates whether Singapore’s re-export sectors buffer or amplify global commodity price shocks.


## Research Questions

**RQ1:** How do sector-level re-export values shift relative to pre-disruption baselines?  
**RQ2:** Do re-export growth rates display higher or lower volatility than benchmark commodity prices during disruptions?


## Disruption Windows

- **COVID-19:** 2020-01 to 2023-05  
- **Russia–Ukraine War:** 2022-02 onward  
- **Red Sea Crisis:** 2023-10 onward  


## Sector Scope

- Petroleum
- Electronics
- Machinery


## Statistical Methods

- Descriptive statistics (mean, std dev, volatility ratios)
- Welch t-test (baseline vs disruption)
- ANOVA + Tukey HSD
- OLS regression (price sensitivity)


## Future Work

- PCA dimensionality analysis  
- volatility clustering  
- forecasting models
